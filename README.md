# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Tanishk

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about cloud computing, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and automation. Currently, I'm working on setting up CI/CD pipelines for deploying resources in **Azure** and **AWS** using **Terraform** and **CloudFormation**.

## Current Projects:

### 1. **Azure Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
- **Tools**: Terraform
- **Resources**: Virtual Networks, Storage Accounts, and more
- **Description**: This project automates the provisioning of Azure resources using Terraform. It's structured with branches for development and production environments, ensuring a smooth and controlled workflow for deploying infrastructure.

### 2. **AWS Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
- **Tools**: CloudFormation
- **Resources**: EC2 Instances, S3 Buckets, and more
- **Description**: The AWS project focuses on deploying resources using CloudFormation templates. It follows a structured branch system to handle different environments, making it easier to manage infrastructure.

Feel free to explore the repos and reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!
